It seems like inside a course each date has its own price, and it can be changed.

Implement next changes:
 - in frontend let user change each date price
 - if the price for a date is different from the main course price, then make that date somehow noticeable in the interface for the user
 - in docs folder create a new n8n_backend_process.json with name "n8n_backend_process_updated.json" inside with implemented changes for backend (fetching date's price and edit date's price)
